# Instructions

There are two (potential) challenges here:
* Deciding what part of your project you want feedback on. The feedback you want will probably be a major driver of your decision about how to share your work-in-progress. For example if you want to know if the text your are displaying is large enough a screen capture could work well, but if you wanted to know if it was on the screen long enough for players to read, you would need a different approach – perhaps a screen recording, or a link to an online timeor or stopwatch.
* Finding a way to share your work-in-progress. This can be quite easy, for example, if you're developing a PDD (project design document) that you're writing in Google Docs, you could just share a link to the document. Or, if you're creating a game using Code.Org's Game Lab you could use the Game Lab **Share** button to get a link. For other projects it way take more work and some research – for example with a Unity game, you could build a WebGL version and host it on GitHub Pages, or you could make screen captures, or perhaps do a screen recording.

Whatever you come up with, remember that it is an experiment – make your best effort to share your work in progress and to get feedback on it and then go a head and submit it.

**Once you've decided on the feedback you want, and how to share your work in progress:**

1. Make sure that you are signed in to your SKSD Google account (otherwise you won't be able to access the document in the next step.
1. Open the [Project Demos][template] Google Doc.
1. On the first line below the headings, add your name, your (former) block, a short description of your project and what you would like us to look at, and a link where we can see it.
1. For your submission, use a link to the Project Demos document.
